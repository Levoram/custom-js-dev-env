# Modernization Changes - Build Scripts

The following build scripts were removed during the migration from Webpack to Vite:

## Removed Files:

- `buildScripts/srcServer.js` - Express dev server with webpack-dev-middleware (replaced by Vite dev server)
- `buildScripts/build.js` - Webpack production build (replaced by `vite build`)
- `buildScripts/distServer.js` - Express production server (replaced by `vite preview`)
- `buildScripts/startMessage.js` - Startup message (no longer needed)
- `buildScripts/testSetup.cjs` - Mocha test setup (replaced by Vitest setup)

## Kept Files:

- `buildScripts/generateMockData.js` - Mock data generation (updated to use @faker-js/faker)
- `buildScripts/mockDataSchema.js` - Mock data schema (unchanged)

## Migration Notes:

- Dev server now runs via `npm run dev` (using Vite)
- Build process now runs via `npm run build` (using Vite + TypeScript)
- Preview production build via `npm run preview` (using Vite)
- Tests now run via `npm run test` (using Vitest)

## CI/CD Modernization

### Updated Configurations:

- **GitHub Actions**: Added modern CI/CD pipeline with cross-platform testing
- **AppVeyor**: Updated to test multiple Node.js versions with comprehensive checks
- **Travis CI**: Removed (legacy CI provider)

### CI Pipeline Improvements:

- **Multi-platform testing**: Ubuntu, Windows, macOS (GitHub Actions)
- **Multi-version testing**: Node.js 20, 22, 24 across remaining CI providers
- **Enhanced checks**: Type checking, linting, formatting, security audits
- **Build verification**: Ensures production builds work correctly
- **Coverage reporting**: Integrated with modern coverage tools
- **Removed legacy CI**: Travis CI removed, focusing on GitHub Actions as primary CI

### CI Script Updates:

- Replaced `npm test` with comprehensive testing pipeline
- Added `npm run type-check` for TypeScript validation
- Added `npm run lint` for code quality checks
- Added `npm run format:check` for formatting validation
- Added `npm run security-check` for vulnerability scanning

### ESLint Configuration:

- **Migrated to ESLint 9**: Updated from ESLint 8 to ESLint 9 with flat config
- **Modern ignore patterns**: Replaced `.eslintignore` with `ignores` property in `eslint.config.js`
